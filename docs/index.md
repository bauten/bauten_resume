## Education


`Graduating JULY 2022`
__Brigham Young University - Idaho__, Rexburg, ID
Bachelor's Degree - Geospatial Computing
Geospatial Technology Certificate




## Work Experience

`Febuary 2022 - July 2022`
__Idaho Falls Power__, Idaho --- GIS Intern

Focused on improving workflow efficiency through the use of digitized forms and storage management. I was able to improve upon skills related to the use of ArcGIS including the formation of feature classes and the ability to integrate data to achieve a desired result. Using these tools, I was able to digitize 7 different forms, eliminating a substantial amount of work, improving storage of data, and increasing the safety of the workers by allowing real-time oversight by dispatch. I also learned to work with a team and to get insights from employees about concerns and possible problems that I could then work to alleviate or solve.

`April 2022 - July 2022`
__Brigham Young University-Idaho__, Idaho --- Drone TA

I worked with the Drone Team and helped establish and optimize existing workflows. Used Enterprise System Drones in multiple projects in order to map and get both lidar and raster data sets. I used Esri products to then integrate that data into the projects.

`January 2013 - Dec 2017`
__Integrated Communications & Data__, California --- Low voltage technician

Installation, termination, splicing, testing, and certification of OSP (Outside Plant) and (ISP) (Inside Plant) copper and fiber optic cabling systems including air blown fiber, and conventional fiber in a variety of commercial applications.  I worked under the direction of a project manager to guide the installation team in the field, read and interpret project drawings, provide as-builts of completed work, and final project close-out.  I performed quality assurance measures to ensure that work was completed in accordance with local standards for AHJ (Authority Having Jurisdiction), and National NEC Code.  I also coordinated work with multiple trades, subcontractors, city and county planners, and local inspectors.  


`March 2009 - Dec 2012`
__Floyd Auten Electric__, California --- Apprentice Electrician

Prior to my work in telecommunications, I apprenticed as an electrician performing the installation of low to medium voltage electrical systems including conduit, wiring, sub panels, main panels, electrical devices, lighting systems, control systems in a variety of commercial applications, including schools, commercial buildings, stadiums, etc.  This experience was paramount to learning how to be a team player, how to coordinate and work with others to accomplish a larger objective, and to do whatever it takes to complete a project safely.
